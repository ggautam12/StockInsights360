	This Python script is designed to perform a series of data engineering tasks focused on financial data analysis, specifically for stocks. It involves connecting to a MySQL database to fetch historical stock data, performing data preprocessing and feature engineering, training a machine learning model to predict stock prices, and finally visualizing the analysis results in both static and interactive formats. Below is a breakdown of its main components and processes:

Database Connection
The script starts by establishing a connection to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy's create_engine function. It uses credentials (username, password, host, port, database name) to build the connection string and connect to the Stocks.io database.
Directory Setup for Plots
It checks if a specific directory exists for saving plots; if not, it creates one. This directory is located at C:\Users\Gautam Batman\stock_plots.

Data Fetching and Preparation
The script iterates through years from 2014 to 2024, constructing a table name for each year and executing a SQL query to fetch data from these yearly tables. This data is concatenated into a single DataFrame, historical_data, for further analysis.
It ensures the 'Date' column is in datetime format, facilitating time-series analysis.

Feature Engineering
New features are created from the historical stock data, including 10-day and 30-day moving averages (MA10, MA30), volatility (standard deviation of closing prices over 30 days), and daily percentage change in closing prices. These features are intended to capture short-term trends, volatility, and momentum in stock prices, which are useful for predictive modeling.
Predictive Modeling with XGBoost
The script selects relevant features for training a predictive model using XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting library for machine learning. The model is trained to predict future closing prices of stocks.
Data is scaled using StandardScaler to normalize feature values, ensuring that the model's performance is not biased by the scale of the data.
The dataset is split into training and test subsets to evaluate the model's performance.

Prediction and Analysis
The script makes predictions for recent data (years 2023 and beyond) and calculates predicted growth for each stock. It then selects the top 5 stocks based on predicted growth for further analysis.

Visualization
Static plots are generated for the top 5 stocks, showing both actual and predicted closing prices over time. These plots are saved to the specified directory.
An interactive plot is created for a user-specified ticker symbol using Plotly, showing a line chart of actual vs. predicted closing prices. This plot is also saved to the directory.

Database Interaction for Plot Metadata
The script includes a function to insert metadata about the generated plots (ticker symbol and file path) into a MySQL database. This function demonstrates how to execute SQL commands (insertion) within a Python script, using mysql.connector.

Yearly Growth Analysis
Another function is designed to calculate and plot the top 2 stocks by growth for each year. It calculates monthly growth, sums it up to get annual growth, and identifies the top 2 performers. These results are visualized in static plots and saved, with metadata also inserted into the database.

Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to manage exceptions that might occur during the processing of data for each year, ensuring the script can continue running even if it encounters issues with specific datasets.

Summary
As a data engineer, this script demonstrates proficiency in several key areas: database interaction, data preprocessing and analysis, machine learning modeling, and data visualization. It showcases the ability to integrate various data sources, apply analytical techniques to derive insights, and effectively communicate those insights through visualizations.
